# Exercise P8.6
Implement a `Car` class with the following properties.
A car has a certain fuel efficiency (measured in miles/gallon) and a certain amount of fuel in the gas tank.
The efficiency is specified in the constructor, and the initial fuel level is `0`.
Supply a method `drive` that simulates driving the car for a certain distance, reducing the fuel in the gas tank,
    and method `getGas`, to return the current fuel level, and `addGas`, to tank up.

Sample usage:
```
Car car = new Car(50); // 50 miles/gallon
car.AddGas(20);        // Tank 20 gallons
car.Drive(100);        // Drive 100 miles
Console.WriteLine("Fuel remaining: {0} gallons", car.GetGas());
```
