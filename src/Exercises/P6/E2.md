# Exercise P6.2
Write array methods that carry out the following tasks for an array of integers.
For each method, provide a test program.

* A. Swap the first and last elements in the array.
* B. Shift all lements by one to the right and move the last element into the first position.
    * Example: `1,4,9,16,25` would become `25,1,4,9,16`
* C. Repalce all even elements with `0`.
* D. Repalce each element except the first and last by the larger of it's two neighbors.
* E. Remove the middle element if the array length is odd, or the middle two elements if the length is even.
* F. Move all even elements to the front, otherwise preserving the order of the elements.
* G. Return the second-largest element in the array.
* H. Return `true` if the array is currently sorted in increasing order.
* I. Return `true` if the array contains two adjacent duplicate elements.
* J. Return `true` if the array contains duplicate elements (may not be adjacent).
